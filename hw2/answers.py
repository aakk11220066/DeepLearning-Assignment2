**Your answer:**


Write your answer using **markdown** and $\LaTeX$:
```python
The Jacobian tensor would contain the derivatives of every output w.r.t. every 
input, for every sample in the batch, thus the resulting Jacobian tensor would
have size (N,Din,Dout) = (128,1024,2048)  

The above Jacobian tensor would contain 128*1024*2048 numbers, each of which
requires 32 bits, for a total of 8,589,934,592 bits = 1 gigabyte
